# Vite Integration For Go

A Go module that lets you serve your Vue 3, React, or Svelte project from a Go-based web server.  You build your project, tell Go where to find the `dist/` directory, and the module figures out how to load the generated Vue application into a web page.

## Installation

```shell
go get github.com/torenware/vite-go

```

To upgrade to the current version:

```shell
go get -u github.com/torenware/vite-go@latest 
```


## Getting It Into Your Go Project

The first requirement is to [use ViteJS's tooling](https://vitejs.dev/guide/#scaffolding-your-first-vite-project) for your JavaScript code. The easiest thing to do is either to start out this way, or to create a new project and move your files into the directory that Vite creates. Using NPM:

```shell
npm create vite@latest
```

Using Yarn:

```shell
yarn create vite
```

Just answer the questions asked, and away you go.

You will need to position your source files and the generated `dist/` directory so Go can find your  project, the `manifest.json` file that describes it, and the assets that Vite generates for you. You may need to change your `vite.config.js` file (`vite.config.ts` if you prefer using Typescript) to make sure the manifest file is generated as well. Here's what I'm using:

```typescript
/**
 * @type {import('vite').UserConfig}
 */
import { defineConfig } from 'vite';
import vue from '@vitejs/plugin-vue';

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [vue()],
  build: {
    manifest: 'manifest.json',
    rollupOptions: {
      input: {
        main: 'src/main.ts',
      },
    },
  },
});
```  

This, however, is more than you need. A minimal config file would be:

```javascript
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import vue from '@vitejs/plugin-vue'

// https://vitejs.dev/config/
export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [vue()],
  build: {
    manifest: "manifest.json",
  },
})

```

The essential piece here is the vue plugin (or whatever plugin you need instead for React, Preact or Svelte) and the `build.manifest` line, since `vite-go` needs the manifest file to be present in order to work correctly.


Here's some sample pseudo code that uses the go 1.16+ embedding feature for the production build, and a regular disk directory (`frontend` in our case) as a development directory:

```golang

package main

import (
  "embed"
  "html/template"
  "net/http"

  vueglue "github.com/torenware/vite-go"
)

//go:embed "dist"
var dist embed.FS

var vueGlue *vueglue.VueGlue

func main() {
    
    // This:
    
    // Production configuration.
	config := &vueglue.ViteConfig{
		Environment: "production",
		AssetsPath:  "dist",
		EntryPoint:  "src/main.js",
		Platform:    "vue",
		FS:          frontend,
	}

    // OR this:
    
    // Development configuration
	config := &vueglue.ViteConfig{
		Environment: "development",
		AssetsPath:  "frontend",
		EntryPoint:  "src/main.js",
		Platform:    "vue",
		FS:          os.DirFS("frontend"),
	}

  // Parse the manifest and get a struct that describes
  // where the assets are.
  glue, err := vueglue.NewVueGlue(config)
  if err != nil {
    //bail!
  }
  vueGlue = glue
  
  // and set up your routes and start your server....
  
}

func MyHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
  // Now you can pass the glue object to an HTML template
  ts, err := template.ParseFiles("path/to/your-template.tmpl")
  if err != nil {
  	// better handle this...
  }
  ts.Execute(respWriter, vueGlue)

}


```

You will also need to serve your javascript, css and images used by your javascript code to the web. You can use a solution like [`http.FileServer`](https://pkg.go.dev/net/http#FileServer), or the wrapper the library implements that configures this for you:

```golang
   // using the standard library's multiplexer:
	mux := http.NewServeMux()

	// Set up a file server for our assets.
	fsHandler, err := glue.FileServer()
	if err != nil {
		log.Println("could not set up static file server", err)
		return
	}
	mux.Handle("/src/", fsHandler)

```

Some router implementations may alternatively require you to do something more like:

```golang
// chi router
mux := chi.NewMux()

...

mux.Handle("/src/*", fsHandler)

```

YMMV :-)

## Templates

Your template gets the needed tags and links by declaring the glue object in your template and calling RenderTags on, as so:


```HTML
<!doctype html>
<html lang='en'>
{{ $vue := . }}
    <head>
        <meta charset='utf-8'>
        <title>Home - Vue Loader Test</title>
        
        {{ if $vue }}
          {{ $vue.RenderTags }}
        {{ end }}
        
    </head>
    <body>
      <div id="app"></div>
      
    </body>
  </html>
      
 
```

You should check that the glue (`$vue` in our example) is actually defined as I do here, since it will be nil unless you inject it into your template.

The sample program in [`examples/sample-program`](./examples/sample-program) has much more detail, and actually runs.

## Configuration
Vite-Go is fairly smart about your Vite Javascript project, and will examine your package.json file on start up.  If you do not override the standard settings in your vite.config.js file, `vite-go` will probably choose to do the appropriate thing.

As mentioned above, a ViteConfig object must be passed to the `NewVueGlue()` routine, with anything you want to override. Here are the major fields and how to use them:

| Field | Purpose | Default Setting |
|---    |---      |---              |
| **Environment** | What mode you want vite to run in. | development |
| **FS** | A fs.Embed or fs.DirFS | none; required. |
| **JSProjectPath** | Path to your Javascript files | frontend |
| **JSInExternalDir** | Javascript files are kept in a folder outside of the go project | false |  
| **AssetPath** | Location of the built distribution directory | *Production:* dist|
| **Platform** | Any platform supported by Vite. vue and react are known to work; other platforms *may* work if you adjust the other configurations correctly. | Based upon your package.json settings. |
| **EntryPoint** | Entry point script for your Javascript | Best guess based on package.json |
| **ViteVersion** | Vite major version ("2" or "3") | Best guess based on your package.json file in your project. If you want to make sure, specify the version you want. |
| **DevServerPort** | Port the dev server will listen on; typically 3000 in version 2, 5173 in version 3 | Best guess based on version | 
| **DevServerDomain** | Domain serving assets. | localhost |
| **HTTPS** | Whether the dev server serves HTTPS | false |  

## Caveats

This code is relatively new; in particular, there may be some configurations you can use in `vite.config.js` that won't work as I expect. If so: [please open an issue on Github](https://github.com/torenware/vite-go/issues).  I've posted the code so people can see it, and try things out. I think you'll find it useful.
